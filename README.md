# EMF_Scanner
HUB Project for Epitech


This Project is trying to improve the existing EMF messurement tools. 

Our goal is to build with an Arduino and it's modules a tool, with which everybody is able to messure the EMF pollution. 

To archive this goal we build ont he one hand the actual Hardware and on the other hand a webpage to make people aware, and give them a plattform to track their data and share it with others.
